# Detecting-Phishing-Websites-Using-URL-Based-HTML-Based-and-Domain-Based-Features


In evaluating the behavioral patterns that differentiate phishing domains from legitimate websites, the analysis shows that attackers routinely exploit structural irregularities within the URL and the surrounding web environment to avoid detection. The most influential signals come from aspects that phishers can freely manipulate, such as subdomain structure, URL length, unusual redirects, and external resource requests, all of which tend to deviate markedly from the patterns observed in legitimate online services. By combining these URL-level indicators with domain age, certificate trustworthiness, and HTML or JavaScript behavior, we construct a feature representation that captures both the surface-level anomalies and the deeper lifecycle characteristics of fraudulent sites. This layered perspective offers a more dependable foundation for phishing detection, enabling models to generalize effectively even when attackers modify superficial details to evade traditional filters.
